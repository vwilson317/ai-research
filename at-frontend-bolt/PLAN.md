# Audio Transcription to Notes - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Create a beautiful, production-ready audio transcription application that converts audio files to text transcripts and integrates with iCloud for Mac/iPhone workflow.

## Technology Choice: Web Application + API Integration

**Why Web App:**
- Cross-platform compatibility (works on Mac, iPhone, any device)
- Modern UI with React/TypeScript for beautiful interface
- Easy integration with cloud transcription services
- No need for App Store distribution
- Can be accessed via Safari on iPhone for iCloud file integration

## Architecture

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- Beautiful, modern UI with drag-and-drop audio upload
- Progress tracking for transcription jobs
- Text editor for reviewing/editing transcripts
- Export options (plain text, markdown, formatted)
- Responsive design for Mac desktop and iPhone mobile

### Backend Integration
- OpenAI Whisper API for high-quality transcription
- Support for multiple audio formats (MP3, M4A, WAV, FLAC)
- Chunked upload for large files
- Real-time progress updates

### iCloud Integration Strategy
1. **Web-based approach**: Safari on iPhone can access iCloud Drive files
2. **Export workflow**: Download transcripts to iCloud Drive folder
3. **File naming**: Auto-generate meaningful names based on audio file names
